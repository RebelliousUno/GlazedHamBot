# GlazedHamBot
## Settings
To use the bot you'll need to update the `sample-settings.properties` file and rename to `settings.properties`.

## Commands
`!jack`, `!jackset` and `!song` are currently hard coded commands as they have specific functionality.
Other commands can be added or removed from the sqlite database using `!addcmd`, `!editcmd` and `!delcmd`
